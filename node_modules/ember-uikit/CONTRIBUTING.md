# Contributing to ember-uikit

## Coding style

* **Ember** ember-uikit uses the [ember](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember) coding style.
* **Prettier** Install prettier for automatic code formatting. This is also enforced by the CI.
* **Actions** Use closure actions. We prefer dasherized action names like `on-click` rather than `onClick`.

## CI and CD

Travis CI will take care of testing and deploying the demo app. You don't have to care about it.
