This addon is a wrapper for the CSS library [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)
which exposes certain components to give users an easy way for using UIkit in
ember apps.

`ember-uikit` is heavily inspired by [Vuikit](https://github.com/vuikit/vuikit) which does a tremendous job in bringing UIkit to Vue apps.

**WARNING: This addon is still in alpha! Contributions are very welcome.**

## Installation

Install the ember-cli addon in your ember-cli project:

```shell
$ ember install ember-uikit
```

This will also install `ember-cli-sass` and add the needed SASS include to `app/styles/app.scss`.
