In 1915, plans to carve a Confederate monument on the mountain’s face and the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan on the top of the mountain made it a prominent site for celebrating Confederate Lost Cause mythology.</p>\n\n<p>The mountain remained in private hands until the 1950s when it was purchased by the State of Georgia. The state oversaw the completion of a carving on the mountain depicting three Confederate leaders and operated the site as a Confederate memorial.
