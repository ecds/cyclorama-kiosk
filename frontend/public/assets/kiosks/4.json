Logan","description":"<p>The most prominent figure in The Battle of Atlanta is U.S. Major General John A. “Blackjack” Logan. He led the counterattack that defeated Confederate forces after they had broken through the Union line near the Troup Hurt House. The 15th Corps commander temporarily took leadership of the U.S. Army of the Tennessee, following the death of Major General James B. McPherson earlier that day.</p>\n\n<p>After the war, Logan was one of the most famous heroes in the North. In 1866, he helped found the Grand Army of the Republic, the national organization of U.S. veterans. Two years later, he initiated the first national Memorial Day. Logan represented Illinois as a U.S. representative and senator and ran for vice president in 1884. He was a bitter critic of William T. Sherman, mainly because Sherman refused to give him permanent command of the Army of the Tennessee.</p>\n\n<p>Despite popular tradition, Logan did not sponsor <i>The Battle of Atlanta</i>. The painting was not connected to his political campaigns. Logan's prominence in the painting is due to his friend Theodore R. Davis. Davis sketched a dramatic image of Logan for Harper's Weekly in 1864. Twenty-two years later, Davis used a reverse image of his sketch to represent Logan in the painting. The reverse image became an iconic representation of the general and the cyclorama painting.</p>\n\n<p>Logan visited <i>The Battle of Atlanta</i> in Minneapolis in September 1886 during a reunion of U.S. veterans. After Logan's unexpected death three months later, friends and family held a memorial service for him in the painting rotunda. Today, Logan statues are in Chicago and Washington, D.C., and many streets, towns, and schools are named for

He was shot dead.&nbsp; When the Confederates asked who the officer was, an aide replied, \"Sir, it is General McPherson. You have killed the best man in our army.\"</p>\n\n<p>Word of McPherson's death spread quickly through the Union ranks. At 4:45 p.m., U.S. Major General John A. Logan led the U.S. counterattack with shouts of \"McPherson and revenge!\" Both U.S. Major General William T. Sherman and Confederate General John B. Hood mourned the loss of their friend.</p>\n\n<p>After the war, McPherson's death was seen as the central event in the Battle of Atlanta. The cyclorama artists chose not to include a scene of his death because he was killed on another part of the battlefield and before actions depicted in the painting. Instead, artists painted the ambulance in which his body was taken to General Sherman's headquarters. It is visible at the tree line to the right of the house.</p>\n\n<p>A monument in present-day East Atlanta marks the spot where McPherson was killed. Erected in 1877 by U.S. Army officers, it was the first monument placed on any Atlanta-area battlefield.
